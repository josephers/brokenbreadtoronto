          <h1 class="text-info">About our Church</h1>

          <p class="lead">It started as a prayer meeting with 6 people. As we prayed we began to sense two things: First, that this church would be a church primarily for ‘prodigals’ – that is, for those who have left the church and for those with no church background. Second, that the church would be in the heart of the GTA.</p>

          <p class="lead">Broken Bread Toronto quietly met as a church for the first time on May 5, 2013 in a house in Thornhill. Six weeks later we moved to Hotel Novotel in North York and launched officially on July 28, 2013.</p>

          <h1 class="text-info">About the Pastor</h1>

          <p class="lead">Chang Cho is a life-long Torontonian. He attended Jarvis Collegiate and graduated without distinction from the University of Toronto. He obtained his Master of Divinity from Tyndale College and Seminary and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 2008. More importantly, during his life-long relationship with the church, he came to realize three unsettling truths: First, that churches and Christians can be very hostile to those who need God most. Second, that the essential message of Jesus often got mixed up with empty religion. And third, that he himself was guilty of the same. His hope now is to be a part of a church that is faithful to Jesus; where the lost are found, the found are sent, and the world is inspired. </p>

          <h1 class="text-info">About our Name</h1>

          <h3>Broken</h3>

          <p class="lead">Something is broken when it is unable to function in the way for which it was intended. This is an apt metaphor for the human condition. We are broken. We do not and cannot live in the way for which we were created. We were created to love one another and shine for God, but our own hearts betray us and constantly take us away from what is good. We need to be saved from our broken selves.</p>

          <h3>Bread</h3>
          <p class="lead">It is our common food. There is no more universal or accessible form of sustenance than bread. When Jesus said, “I am the bread of life” he was saying that life was to be found in him. No matter who you are, what you’ve done, or where you’ve been, Jesus offers you life. Because of his broken body on the cross, you can now be unbroken.</p>

          <h3>Toronto</h3>

          <p class="lead">Cities matter to God. God has always been concerned with the peace and prosperity of major cities. God is committed to the great cities of this world, and the church must be too. The church will regain relevance in the hearts of believers and unbelievers alike if, and only if, we make our city more beautiful.</p>
