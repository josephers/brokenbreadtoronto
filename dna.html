        <h1 class="text-info">1. Personal Renewal</h1>
        <p class="lead">We believe that sin and brokenness run deep in the human heart. For this reason, our hearts constantly need to be encouraged, strengthened, challenged, and transformed through the preaching of God’s word and participation in community life. Broken Bread Toronto is committed to seeing changed lives. Though attendance and offering can be indicative of church health, our primary measure of success will be whether or not our people possess love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control in increasing measure in their daily lives. We strive to be a church that understands your heart and helps you live a contended and fruitful life.</p>

        <h1 class="text-info">2. Member Participation </h1>
        <p class="lead">If it is true that the work of Jesus has reconciled us to our Heavenly Father, then coming to church is like coming home. The theme of exile and homecoming runs throughout the bible to teach us that our true home is with God. This means that those who have accepted God as Father also accept each other as brother and sister with its attendant roles and expectations. Participate in the life of our church not for what you get but for what we all gain. Invite people over for dinner, help someone move, visit a friend in the hospital, have coffee with a newcomer, pray for each other, help out the Children’s ministry. Let’s participate in the lives of one another. </p>

        <h1 class="text-info">3. Community Restoration</h1>
       <p class="lead">Jesus once asked, “Who lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl?” In asking this, he was expressing frustration at the pattern of inwardness amongst believers who, instead of engaging the city and the surrounding culture, huddled into Christian ghettos. This pattern is an easy one to repeat. Broken Bread Toronto strives to do as much good as we can in the surrounding community and we want everyone to be equipped for this purpose. It has been said that the church is the only institution in the world that exists primarily for its non-members. We want as much as possible to be true to this.</p>

        <h1 class="text-info">4. City Inspiration </h1>
        <p class="lead">In speaking about the church, Jesus said, “a city on a hill cannot be hidden.” The church was made to display the love and truth of God so that all would see how beautiful God truly is. This means that churches are called to humbly inspire the people of our city by the good works we do. A wise man once said, “Don’t seek to build a great church, seek to build a great city.”</p>

        <h1 class="text-info">5. Grace Proliferation</h1>
        <p class="lead">All of life is a gift. God shines his light on the righteous and the wicked. Salvation too is a gift. When the reality of God’s grace expressed through the life and death of Jesus Christ truly hits home, one is humbled and given no room to boast. For this reason, Broken Bread Toronto seeks to be a church disarmed of a judgmental spirit that welcomes anyone seeking to find their way. The proliferation of grace means the death of pride and shame. </p>
